# sleek-calendar-view

A custom calendar view for Kintone that enhances the user experience by offering advanced viewing options, filtering capabilities, and interactive elements. The design should be modern and intuitive, allowing users to easily navigate through months, weeks, and days, and to view detailed information about events with minimal clicks. Features should include the ability to filter events by category, tags, or custom fields; a sleek event creation and editing interface; and responsive design to ensure usability across various devices. The color scheme and font style should be adjustable to fit the branding of the Kintone app it's integrated with.
